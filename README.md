The full website has  the following
webpages:
<li><a href="index.html" accesskey="1" title="">Home</a></li><li><a href="aboutme.html" accesskey="3" title="">AboutUs</a></li>
<li><a href="menu.html" accesskey="4" title="">Menu</a></li>
<li><a href="special.html" accesskey="5" title="">Specials</a></li>
<li><a href="signup.html" accesskey="6" title="">Newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="plan.html" accesskey="7" title="">Plan</a></li>


The plan has been updated with these:
<li>Design Comps-There is a link to xd where the two developed pages where designed and created before making the design in html and css codes.</li>
<li>Design Rationalisation</li>
<li>Usability Testing Plan Template:</li>


To get to the usability test plan the link is below or just access the plan as well:
<li><a accesskey="8" href="usability-test-plan.html" title="">Usability Testing Plan</a></li>



if you want check the whole website or just the newsletter part you can use the following:


(The official website) https://keashyn.github.io/CP1406_Assignment2-Keashyn/ 


or


Use XAMPP to check 


Go  a file called instructions.md. The instructions file will tell what to do to test the newsletter or the whole website.
The instructions have these following folders:
<li>Milestone 1</li>
<li>Milestone 2</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>fonts</li>
<li>Images</li>




The two folders which are milestone 1 and 2 are not in GitHub repo as you see  in the zip folder call CP1406_Keashyn_Assignment2_zip
because the link will not show the homepage when you click on  this link "https://keashyn.github.io/CP1406_Assignment2-Keashyn/", so I submit the assignment 2 differently on LearnJCU and on GITHUB.
