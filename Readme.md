If you want to  test the whole website you can use the following:

Link to the official website https://keashyn.github.io/CP1406_Assignment2-Keashyn/
or Use xampp software to check the whole website.

To check if the whole website or just the newsletter part go to the sub-folder called milestone 2. When you found the sub-folder look for a file called instructions.md. The instructions file will tell how to run the whole website in the local host.

Everything here works, and the website works on ipad pro  10'9 inch if you want test  it on an ipad you can but it does'nt work for mobile yet.
